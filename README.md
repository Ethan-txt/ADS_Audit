# ADS_Audit
Audit of an Automated Credit Card Approval System May 2021

### Background
This was a joint project created for Responsible Data Science at NYU (DS-UA 0202).
We go over an automated decision system implemented by a user on Kaggle and designate a data nutrition label which asseses the fairness of the various models. Some of the code was adapted from the original author of the system which we then tested for robustness and result replication. Pandas_Profiling was used for summary statistics while SHAP was also implemented to look more closely at the factors affecting potential disparity between groups of individuals in the data set. The data for this project is not present in this repository, however, it can still be found on Kaggle. 

###Contents
The "ADS_Audit_Report.pdf" contains the complete data nutrition label report while the "ADS_Audit_Code.ipynb" contains the supporting code.
